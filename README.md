# Kubernetes Release

This repo contains the tooling and infrastructure to create Kubernetes releases from the [kubernetes/kubernetes] main repository.

## Intro

There are several scripts and helpers in this repository a release
manager will find useful when managing all kinds of releases (alpha,
beta, official, rc) across branches.

## Tools

Most tools in this repo run by default in *mock* mode to allow for ease in
development and testing.

Tools | Description
 :---: | --
[`gcbmgr`](/gcbmgr)                     | Google Cloud Builder Manager:<br/>This is the main entry point for release managers for producing releases. All release types can be staged and later released using this method.
[`anago`](/anago)                       | Release Tool:<br/>The main driver for creating staged builds and releases. This is what runs inside GCB after a job is submitted using `gcbmgr`.
[`branchff`](/branchff)                 | Fast-forward branching helper:<br/>A tool used to pull new patches onto the release branch.
[`find_green_build`](/find_green_build) | Asks Jenkins for a good build to use.
[`release-notes`](/cmd/release-notes)   | Scrape GitHub for release notes.<br/>See [Release Notes Gathering](#release-notes-gathering) for more information.
[`prin`](/prin)                         | To show release tags of a particular PR or commit.
[`changelog-update`](/changelog-update) | Updates [CHANGELOG.md] version entries by rescanning github for text and label changes.
[`push-build.sh`](/push-build.sh)       | Pushes a developer build or CI Jenkins build up to GCS.
[`script-template`](/script-template)   | Generates a script template in the kubernetes/release ecosystem.
[`testgridshot`](/testgridshot)         | Screenshots failing testgrid dashboards and creates a markdown stub that can be copied and pasted into a GitHub issue comment.<br/>This makes it easier to create comments like [this][shot-issue] as part of the release process.

## Release Notes Gathering

For more extensive build and usage documentation for the `release-notes` tool, see the [documentation](./cmd/release-notes/README.md).

Once the tool is installed, use `-h` or `--help` to see the command usage:

```
$ release-notes -h
Usage of release-notes:
  -end-sha string
        The commit hash to end at
  -format string
        The format for notes output (options: markdown, json) (default "markdown")
  -github-token string
        A personal GitHub access token (required)
  -output string
        The path to the where the release notes will be printed
  -start-sha string
        The commit hash to start at
```

## Building Linux Packages

### For Debian

You can build the deb packages in a Docker container like this:
```
docker build --tag=debian-packager debian
docker run --volume="$(pwd)/debian:/src" debian-packager
```

The build runs for a while, after it's done you will find the output in `debian/bin`.

### For Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux

You can build the rpm packages in a Docker container with:

```
cd rpm
./docker-build.sh
```

Resulting rpms, and a pre-generated yum repository will be generated in rpm/output/x86_64.
